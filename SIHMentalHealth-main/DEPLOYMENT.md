# Deployment Guide for Render

## Static Site Deployment on Render

This project is now configured for deployment as a static site on Render.

### Build Configuration

- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Publish Directory**: `dist`
- **Node Version**: 18+ (recommended)

### Files Created for Deployment

1. **`render.yaml`** - Render deployment configuration
2. **`public/_redirects`** - Handles SPA routing (redirects all routes to index.html)
3. **`public/images/`** - Static assets (Logo.png, water.jpg, backgroundHome.png)

### Key Changes Made

1. **Fixed Logo Paths**: Changed from `/src/images/Logo.png` to `/images/Logo.png`
2. **Updated Vite Config**: Simplified configuration and set proper build output
3. **Fixed Import Paths**: Removed version numbers from all UI component imports
4. **Added SPA Routing**: Created `_redirects` file to handle client-side routing
5. **Moved Static Assets**: Moved images to `public/` folder for proper deployment
6. **Assessment-First Flow**: Modified routing to start directly with assessment page (no login required)
7. **Updated Navigation**: Changed default route from `/` (assessment) to `/home` (main app) after completion

### Deployment Steps

1. Connect your GitHub repository to Render
2. Choose "Static Site" as the service type
3. Set the build command to: `npm run build`
4. Set the publish directory to: `dist`
5. Deploy!

### Troubleshooting

- **Logo not showing**: Ensure images are in `public/images/` folder
- **404 on refresh**: The `_redirects` file should handle this
- **Build errors**: Check that all import paths are correct (no version numbers)

The site should now work properly on Render with all assets loading correctly and SPA routing functioning as expected.

### User Flow

1. **Landing**: Users land directly on the assessment page (`/`)
2. **Assessment**: Users complete the assessment (with "Skip to Last Question" button for testing)
3. **Completion**: After assessment completion, users see a congratulations popup
4. **Home**: Users are redirected to the main app homepage (`/home`)
5. **Navigation**: Users can navigate through all app features from the main interface

No login is required - the assessment page is the entry point for all users.
